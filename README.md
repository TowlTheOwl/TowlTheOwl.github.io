# **TowlTheOwl**

I am a student at the University of Washington majoring in Computer Science with an interest in applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to address real-world challenges in healthcare.

My long-term goal is to work at the intersections of disciplines like computer science, biology, neuroscience, and medicine, investigating how computational methods can be integrated to lead breakthroughs in diagnosis, treatment, and personalized care.

As I continue my studies, I aim to engage in research that integrates artificial intelligence with the life sciences, contributing to innovations that are both technically rigorous and socially meaningful.
